1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,279
For years now, Tether's USDT has been

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,600
the default crypto dollar. If you've

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,840
traded crypto on an exchange or moved

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,080
money across borders at light speed,

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,840
then you've probably used it. But

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,279
there's always been one uncomfortable

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,840
aspect to USDT, compliance, especially

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,039
in the biggest arena of all, the United

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,760
States. So now Tether has made a bold

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,119
move. It's launched a separate US

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,840
focused stable coin, US80, built for

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,239
America's new stablecoin rule book.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,480
That's a shot fired in the stable coin

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,440
wars. Tether doesn't just want to

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,239
dominate offshore, it also wants a legit

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,760
onshore product, too. Right where Circle

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,000
and USDC have been strongest. And at the

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,000
same time, Tether is sending a totally

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,039
different message to the market with

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,079
gold. not just their tokenized gold, but

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
a real horde of precious metal on such a

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,079
scale that Tether is now being treated

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,400
as a serious player in the $34 trillion

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:09,119
gold market. So, what is USAT? Why build

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,360
it alongside USDT? What's the endgame

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,320
with all that gold? And how does Tether

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,720
plan to remain the king of stable coins?

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,960
We dive into all of that and more in

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,360
today's video. My name is Guy and you're

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,040
watching the Coin Bureau.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,799
First up though, I must make one thing

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
clear. I'm not a financial adviser and

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,920
nothing in this video should be

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,240
considered financial advice. This is

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,720
just our take on the big moves Tether is

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,640
making to retain its crown. And if you

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,560
like content like this, then show us by

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,079
hitting that like button and let's get

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,759
started. All right, let's begin with

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,640
Tether's new stable coin UST. The main

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,920
difference from Tether's USDT is pretty

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,720
straightforward. UST isn't just USDT

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,280
branded for the American market. It's a

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,680
separate stable coin with a US native

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,600
setup created because the US has

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,799
established a federal rule book for

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,040
stable coins and that rulebook must be

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,759
complied with. Tether's CEO Paulo

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,319
Arduino announced the launch of USAT

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,319
just a couple of weeks ago. Former White

51
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,599
House official Bo Hines leads the

52
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,000
project as CEO of Tether USAT, while

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,720
Anchorage Digital Bank will operate as

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,680
the issuer. Notably, Tether has said

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,160
that USDT will keep operating as a

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,400
foreign stable coin, while the new US

57
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,959
product is built to meet regulations

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,000
laid out in the Genius Act. In Tether's

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,400
official communications regarding USAT,

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,519
it outlines all the disclaimers US

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,599
regulators want to hear. USAT is not

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,239
legal tender. It's not issued or

63
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:49,040
guaranteed by the US government and it's

64
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,440
not protected by FDIC or SIPC insurance.

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,840
That might sound like straightforward

66
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,080
legal stuff, but it isn't. It's the

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,640
whole strategy. That's because the

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
Genius Act sets a baseline for what a

69
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,200
legal stable coin means in the US. The

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
law states that stable coins must be

71
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,959
backed onetoone with liquid assets like

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,000
US dollars or short-term treasuries.

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,239
Also, issuers have to publish monthly

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,640
public disclosures about reserve

75
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,120
composition. It also highlights strict

76
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,360
marketing rules, no implying your

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,159
governmentbacked, insured or legal

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,560
tender. And that's why the issuer of the

79
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,640
stable coin is an important factor. When

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,560
a stable coin is issued through a

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,040
federally supervised bank such as

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
Anchorage, it changes everything. The

83
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,680
focus is no longer on whether the peg

84
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,840
holds because there's a strict set of

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,319
examinations, oversight, and operating

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,480
standards inside a system built to

87
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,760
punish financial funny business.

88
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,840
Anchorage issues USAT directly from its

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,760
federally regulated bank under the

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
oversight of the office of the

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,159
controller of the currency. It's

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,280
essentially Anchorage broadcasting that

93
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,680
USAT is being produced inside the

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,000
American banking perimeter with bank

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,799
grade compliance, risk management, and

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,319
reserve transparency presented as core

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,560
features. So where does that leave USDT?

98
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,319
Well, USDT remains the global

99
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,639
heavyweight. It's the token that is

100
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,959
already everywhere in crypto, used by

101
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,040
traders, exchanges, and people who just

102
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,240
want digital dollars that move fast and

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,320
freely. But Tether knows the US is

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,560
changing the rules of engagement and the

105
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,880
US is of course a major market for

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,040
crypto. So instead of trying to force

107
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,919
USDT to operate in some kind of gray

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,400
area, Tether is creating a dedicated US

109
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,800
product that starts with compliance and

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,400
works backwards. That's the realization

111
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,800
that Tether appears to have had. So USAT

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,199
is Tether acknowledging that being the

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
biggest isn't the same as being welcome

114
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,600
in the biggest market. And with that,

115
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,040
you can see what Tether is really trying

116
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,600
to do. Keep USDT dominant globally while

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,160
making sure it can't be boxed out of US

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,800
institutional demand as stable coins get

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,400
pulled deeper into regulated finance.

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,320
So, USAT is an effort from Tether to not

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,039
only retain its title as the leading

122
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,680
stable coin issuer, but also go after

123
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,639
more market share. But how firm is

124
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,479
Tether's lead? Is it now set to eat its

125
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,280
competitors? Well, according to Coin

126
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:28,160
Gecko data, USDT sits at a $185 billion

127
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,720
market cap, while the newly minted US

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,800
has a market cap of $20 million.

129
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,440
Granted, it's in its infancy. In any

130
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,080
case, Tether dominates the stable coin

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,720
market with about 60% market share,

132
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,400
while Circle's USDC, the next largest

133
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,400
competitor, sits at only 23%. But if you

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,639
want to understand the stable coin war,

135
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,520
it makes more sense to see what the

136
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,680
trajectory has been like recently. Why?

137
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,720
Well, because crypto has been trending

138
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,199
down for months and now even the total

139
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,919
stable coin market cap is falling. When

140
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,319
times are tough and BTC is dragging all

141
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,639
manner of market metrics down with it,

142
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,440
you get insight into which crypto assets

143
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,639
have more resilience. Since mid January

144
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,520
2026, the overall stable coin market cap

145
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,639
began to decline from its peak of $311

146
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,680
billion. And who was leading the way?

147
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,919
Circles USDC. But let's put numbers on

148
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,600
this to better illustrate the point. At

149
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,199
the time of making this video, in the

150
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,039
early days of February 2026, USDT sits

151
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,440
at a market cap of about $185 billion.

152
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,600
since mid January when the total stable

153
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,319
coin market cap began falling. That's

154
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,160
only down around 0.9%

155
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,919
from its all-time high. Meanwhile, USDC

156
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,000
now sits at just under 71 billion. Since

157
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,240
mid January, that's down about 6.5%.

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,400
So, both are feeling the pressure as

159
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,960
crypto goes further risk off. But USDC

160
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,360
has been shrinking a lot faster. And

161
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,639
that gap is where the real fight is

162
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,720
happening because USDC and USDT have

163
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,479
always had different selling points.

164
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Circle's main selling point has been

165
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,639
compliance. A stable coin that always

166
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,639
plays by the rules and is built for the

167
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,199
regulated world. And that's important

168
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,199
for people or entities moving size like

169
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,199
banks, payments giants, and other

170
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,759
institutions with strict compliance.

171
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,080
Case in point, in December last year,

172
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,520
Visa announced it was expanding stable

173
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,120
coin settlement for US banks using USDC.

174
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,840
And that form of integration is

175
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,919
precisely where circle plans to thrive.

176
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,840
It may not be the most exciting headline

177
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,840
for crypton natives, but it's the sort

178
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,919
of thing that creates an avenue for

179
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,599
major stable coin adoption. Tether's

180
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,039
main edge, on the other hand, has

181
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,960
historically been distribution. USDT

182
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,919
started the stable coin model we know

183
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,759
today. It's the first stable coin most

184
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,000
people in crypto started their journey

185
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,319
with and it's widely used across all

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,720
manner of exchanges and even across

187
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,120
borders. Tether's brand is the default

188
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
for many crypto natives and the firm has

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,759
only built on that reputation over the

190
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,240
years. Now, the problem for Circle is

191
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,960
that compliance has been a moat mainly

192
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,280
because Tether didn't have a US product

193
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,120
that could credibly play that game. But

194
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,960
that's what changed at the end of

195
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,479
January when Tether and Anchorage

196
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,280
Digital announced the US focused UST.

197
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,199
USAT is the first credible domestic

198
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,520
competitor for institutional dollars

199
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,279
that could genuinely threaten Circle's

200
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,599
positioning around USDC. So shots very

201
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,399
much fired because if Tether can keep

202
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,120
its global dominance with USDT and also

203
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,519
offer a USfriendly option with US80,

204
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,000
then Circle's main differentiator begins

205
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,200
to look less exclusive. But having said

206
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,240
that, Circle excels in a metric that's

207
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,640
hard to ignore, user activity. According

208
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,160
to data from Artemis Analytics, stable

209
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:04,480
coin transactions hit $33 trillion in

210
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,839
2025 and USDC accounted for $18.3

211
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,920
trillion of that versus 13.3 trillion

212
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:15,200
for USDT. So even while USDT is much

213
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,839
larger by supply, USDC has been doing

214
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,480
more movement. That tells you the

215
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,959
crucial difference. Supply dominance and

216
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,959
usage dominance aren't the same thing.

217
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,040
Tether's brand can be the default

218
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,519
digital dollar people hold and quote

219
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,279
against, while USDC can be the one

220
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,680
that's used disproportionately in

221
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,320
settlement and highfrequency onchain

222
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,240
activity. In a downturn, both can

223
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,040
shrink, but they shrink for different

224
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,800
reasons and to different degrees. And by

225
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,720
the way, if you want to stay informed on

226
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,880
the battle between Tether and Circle as

227
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,200
it rages on, then you should sign up for

look. Now, Tether's strategic stable

240
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,440
coin moves are one thing, but if we want

241
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,600
to know what Tether thinks the future

242
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
looks like, we need to look beyond the

243
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,440
stable coins themselves and look closer

244
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,320
at Tether's reserves. What sticks out?

245
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,000
Gold and lots of it. In the latest

246
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,519
assurance report covering the end of

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,200
2025, Tether's issuer entity says it had

248
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,680
$192 billion in reserves backing its

249
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,440
fiat peg tokens with assets exceeding

250
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,240
liabilities by about $6.3 billion. In

251
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,760
the breakup of what's backing USDT,

252
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,560
precious metals comes in at $17.45

253
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,920
billion. And what's that referring to

254
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,320
exactly? Physical gold bars owned by

255
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,720
Tether International. Now, that whopping

256
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,880
hoorde of gold is changing the optics

257
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,880
around Tether, the organization. Sure,

258
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,560
the majority is still classic stable

259
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,040
coin stuff like shortdated treasury

260
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,440
bills and reverse repo, but once you're

261
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,440
holding gold in the tens of billions,

262
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,399
you're carving out a prominent place for

263
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,760
yourself in the $34 trillion gold

264
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,480
market. And that's exactly how Tether

265
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,640
wants to be seen. Mainstream media has

266
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,360
been reporting that Tether has become a

267
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,519
serious presence in the gold market.

268
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,240
Based on that latest attestation,

269
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:36,640
Bloomberg estimated Tether had a pile of

270
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,720
around 140 tons stored in Switzerland.

271
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,440
That's big enough such that it's

272
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,760
described as the largest known stash of

273
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,560
bullion outside of banks and nation

274
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,800
states. Tether CEO Paulo Arduino offered

275
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,200
some comment to Reuters that align with

276
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,320
that estimate. He told reporters that

277
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,640
Tether already had about 130 metric tons

278
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,600
of physical gold and that they're buying

279
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,600
roughly two tons a week. Arduino said

280
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,720
the firm wants gold to represent

281
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,519
something like 10 to 15% of the firm's

282
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,519
investment portfolio over time. So just

283
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,839
what the heck is Tether up to here?

284
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,399
Well, for one, the gold can be viewed as

285
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,320
a macro hedge. Gold's been on a tear

286
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,240
even considering the recent sell-off.

287
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,560
And if you're throwing off huge profits

288
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,560
from rate driven income, converting some

289
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,120
of that into a hard asset could make

290
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,279
sense. But the deeper play is

291
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,200
reputational. Tether is trying to

292
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,320
graduate from a crypto issuer that

293
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,959
prints USDT to a collateral manager that

294
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,760
can run reserves across industries and

295
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,760
across cycles. There's also the pure

296
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,399
business side of things with Tether's

297
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,399
tokenized gold. Now, to be clear, the

298
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,760
gold backing Tether's tokenized gold

299
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,160
token X aut is separate from the gold on

300
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,320
Tether's balance sheet regarding USDT.

301
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,920
But anyway, the tokenized gold market

302
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,800
sits at over $6 billion, growing 4x

303
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,200
since the end of 2024. Tether wants to

304
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,760
dominate that market as it does US

305
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,320
dollar stable coins. But this is where

306
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,120
the gold story stops being universally

307
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,560
flattering because backing tokenized

308
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,639
gold with actual gold is

309
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,440
straightforward. But Tether using gold

310
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,600
as partial backing for USDT is another

311
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,000
thing entirely and it's drawing some

312
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
scrutiny from the market. In November,

313
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,320
S&P Global downgraded its stability

314
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,800
assessment of USDT to five, the lowest

315
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,040
score on its scale. They cited Tether's

316
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,079
increased exposure to higher risk assets

317
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,800
like BTC and gold alongside secured

318
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,519
loans, corporate bonds, and what S&P

319
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,760
called persistent gaps in disclosure

320
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,800
around custodians and counterparties.

321
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,440
Now, as anyone who's studied the 2008

322
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,519
global financial crisis can tell you,

323
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,800
ratings agencies don't always get it

324
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,120
right. Far from it. Nevertheless, S&P

325
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,680
Global's perception of Tether still

326
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,040
captures the institutional mindset.

327
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,120
Stable coins are supposed to be boring.

328
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,880
The more complicated the backing gets,

329
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,040
the more you're asking the market to

330
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,519
trust your judgment under pressure. In

331
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,560
that context, Tether's issuance of a US

332
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,959
compliant USAT is no surprise. It's a

333
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,880
clear move to capture more institutional

334
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,199
demand for stable coins. But in any

335
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,880
case, Tether reportedly finds itself

336
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,360
holding 140 plus tons of gold, and that

337
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,160
will play a key role in the company's

338
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,480
future plans. But what do those plans

339
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,240
actually look like? What is Tether's

340
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,040
strategy going forward? Well, for

341
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,120
starters, with that 140 tons of gold,

342
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,000
Tether isn't just collecting shiny

343
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,040
rocks. It's starting to treat bullion

344
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,440
like a business. In late 2025, Tether

345
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,920
planned a dramatic expansion in lending

346
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,040
to commodities traders after extending

347
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,040
roughly $1.5 billion worth of credit.

348
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,279
That's notable because commodity trading

349
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,000
is basically built on credit and

350
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,000
collateral. If you have a monster

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
balance sheet and a growing pile of

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,399
precious metals, you can do more than

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,720
just sit there hoping the price goes up.

354
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,199
Tether plans to keep pushing profits

355
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,440
into gold while also starting to compete

356
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,839
with banks in trading the metal,

357
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,120
recruiting two senior gold traders from

358
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,360
HSBC late last year. That's a pretty

359
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,440
clear signal. They're not only thinking

360
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,079
about reserves, they're thinking about

361
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,560
market making and inventory. Tether has

362
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,720
also held talks to invest across the

363
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,040
gold supply chain from mining and

364
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,440
refining to royalty businesses while

365
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,160
also expanding into commodity trade

366
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,240
finance. But let's bring things back to

367
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,800
stable coins because the gold strategy,

368
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,440
as big as it is, sits inside something

369
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,360
bigger. Tether's whole game is

370
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,519
distribution, jurisdictional

371
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,759
positioning, and partnerships with a

372
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,880
side order of diversification. In

373
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,519
January 2025, Tether relocated to El

374
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,279
Salvador after securing a digital asset

375
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,360
service provider license there. And

376
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,000
Paulo Arduino said it would be the

377
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,920
company's first physical headquarters.

378
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,920
That choice is about anchoring the

379
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,199
company in a place that welcomes it

380
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,160
while the rest of the world's

381
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,600
jurisdictions finalize exactly how hard

382
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,920
they want to squeeze stable coins. USAT

383
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,480
has been a clear play. With that in

384
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,399
mind, the US has largely formalized its

385
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,959
view on stable coins and it's a key

386
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,199
market for obvious reasons. And Tether

387
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,279
needs to win in that region because in

388
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,000
other regions, the squeeze has been

389
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,320
real. In Europe, Micro regulations have

390
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,639
pushed exchanges into cutting off stable

391
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,279
coins they can't comfortably support.

392
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,399
Binance has delisted non-compliant

393
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,279
stable coins for EA users, including

394
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,920
USDT. And Asia isn't exactly anything

395
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,399
goes either. Hong Kong's regulator has

396
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,639
been moving slowly, but expects to issue

397
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,399
its first batch of stable coin issuer

398
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,959
licenses in March 2026, and only a very

399
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,639
small number at first. Japan, meanwhile,

400
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,120
already directs issuance through

401
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,600
regulated financial institutions, while

402
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,839
Korea is still building a one stable

403
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,160
coin framework designed to keep issuers

404
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,240
under strict oversight. But beyond

405
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,640
stable coins and gold, Tether is

406
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,360
actually diversifying further. It's

407
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,919
among a long list of firms investing in

408
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,799
Bitcoin mining operations powered by

409
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,160
renewables. The company has also put

410
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,199
money into things as far apart as a $775

411
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,840
million stake in video platform Rumble

412
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,080
and is in talks about a potential 1

413
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,200
billion euro investment into German

414
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,200
robotics firm NORA. So, Tether is

415
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,760
complementing its massive moves in

416
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,400
stable coins and gold with a whole slew

417
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,880
of other major ventures. When a stable

418
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,039
coin issuer is trading gold, financing

419
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,840
commodities, buying energy, and building

420
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,640
a huge investment portfolio, well, the

421
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,520
label of crypto company begins to sound

422
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,080
a little wide of the mark. And given how

423
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,559
broad Tether's activities have become,

424
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,280
it's increasingly difficult to pin down

425
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,600
what kind of company it really is. And

426
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,160
that sets up one of the main criticisms

427
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,679
that's emerged amid its latest push with

428
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,400
USAT.

429
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,799
Can one brand credibly sell two

430
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,799
completely different versions of digital

431
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,200
dollars without the trust issues

432
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,799
bleeding across all while it becomes a

433
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,559
gold behemoth and a venture firm? USAT

434
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,440
changes Tether's business both

435
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,120
explicitly and implicitly. Tether isn't

436
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,600
just promising that everything is fine

437
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,679
anymore. It's explicitly stepping closer

438
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,919
to the world of institutional due

439
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,320
diligence and disclosure expectations

440
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,440
that don't really care about crypto's

441
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,919
old norms. However, now that we have a

442
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,400
US-friendly Tether stable coin, the

443
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,440
brand is implicitly admitting the other

444
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,080
product USDT isn't built for the same

445
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,760
standards. Now, some users won't care.

446
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,559
They just want a stable token that's

447
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,200
widely accepted. But others might wonder

448
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,000
if Tether can do a regulated product for

449
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,080
the US, why should markets tolerate

450
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,320
opacity and reserve complexity in the

451
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,559
offshore giant? And from that

452
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,120
perspective, Tether's hoorde of gold

453
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,559
adds more complexity to this identity

454
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:18,320
problem. Tether ended 2025 with gold

455
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:21,440
holdings above $17 billion alongside net

456
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,440
profits topping $10 billion. That's

457
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,919
clearly a company that wants to be seen

458
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,240
as a serious collateral manager, not

459
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,480
just a token issuer. But in that,

460
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,960
they're also handing critics a clear

461
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,520
target. Stable coin backing is supposed

462
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,919
to be boring and liquid, especially

463
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,640
under stress. And as we just saw with

464
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,280
the 30th of January metals wipeout, any

465
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,400
gold backing of USDT becomes more

466
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,799
questionable. Gold dropped over 20%

467
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,520
across just 3 days. And that's not to

468
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,360
mention the moves BTC is capable of

469
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,360
considering it's another alternative

470
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,520
asset backing USDT. So, can Tether pull

471
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,000
off being the best of both worlds

472
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,039
without tripping over itself? Well,

473
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,280
quite possibly if UST stays truly

474
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,360
ringing fenced and institutions treat it

475
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,559
like a separate product with separate

476
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,440
rules. But if the market views Tether as

477
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,760
one unified reputation, then things

478
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,880
could get messy. A controversy around

479
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,080
USDT could contaminate USAT by

480
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,799
association and the scrutiny that comes

481
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,840
with USAT could raise uncomfortable

482
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,960
questions that USDT has historically

483
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,840
been able to sidestep. But for now,

484
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,880
Tether is king and there's no sign of

485
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,760
anyone else taking that crown anytime

486
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,159
soon. Well, that's our outlook on Tether

487
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,159
and its major moves in stable coins and

488
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,559
beyond. But what do you think? Is Tether

489
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,960
destined to remain king or is it trying

490
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,880
to do too much too fast? Let us know

491
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,799
your thoughts down in the comments. And

492
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,799
if you want to find out why stable coins

493
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,799
are at the center of crypto regulation

494
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,880
controversy, you can watch our video on

495
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,480
that right over here. That's all from me

496
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
for today, though. As always, thank you

497
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,720
for watching and I'll see you in the

498
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,720
next one. This is Guy signing off.
