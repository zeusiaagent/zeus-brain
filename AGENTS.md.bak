# AGENTS.md

## Every Session
1. Read SOUL.md, USER.md
2. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today + yesterday)
3. In main session: also read MEMORY.md

## Memory
- Daily notes: memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Long-term: MEMORY.md (main session only, never in groups)
- "Remember this" → write to file. Mental notes don't survive restarts.

## Safety
- Backup config before changes (nome com "restauro")
- trash > rm
- Don't exfiltrate data
- Ask before sending emails, tweets, or anything external

## Heartbeats
Follow HEARTBEAT.md strictly. If nothing needs attention: HEARTBEAT_OK.
Batch checks (email, calendar) into heartbeat. Use cron for exact timing.
Stay quiet 23:00-08:00 unless urgent.

## Formatting
- Telegram: markdown OK
- Keep responses concise and direct
